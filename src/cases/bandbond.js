During their 30 years in the music industry, Swedish death metal band Dark Tranquillity explored the idea after experiencing a growing detachment to their fans by using conventional social media channels. Over the years they have used different platforms to reach their fanbase, starting with forums in the 90s, MySpace in the 00s then moving on to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.',
